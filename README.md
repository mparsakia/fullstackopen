Note, please check the .gitignore file to see which files are not uploaded to GitHub.

Most folders will only contain the src, as I reuse the same env in VSCode as I work through practice problems.
Should an env need to be rebuilt, use the package.json data in part1/anecdotes, unless a subfolder has a package.json, then use that one to rebuild the project.
