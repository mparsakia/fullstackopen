const courseParts = [
  {
    name: "Fundamentals",
    exerciseCount: 10,
    description: "This is an awesome course part"
  },
  {
    name: "Using props to pass data",
    exerciseCount: 7,
    groupProjectCount: 3
  },
  {
    name: "Deeper type usage",
    exerciseCount: 14,
    description: "Confusing description",
    exerciseSubmissionLink: "https://fake-exercise-submit.made-up-url.dev"
  }
];


Let's start by defining types for our different course parts:

interface CoursePartOne {
  name: "Fundamentals";
  exerciseCount: number;
  description: string;
}

interface CoursePartTwo {
  name: "Using props to pass data";
  exerciseCount: number;
  groupProjectCount: number;
}

interface CoursePartThree {
  name: "Deeper type usage";
  exerciseCount: number;
  description: string;
  exerciseSubmissionLink: string;
}

Next we will create a type union of all these types. We can then use it to define a type for our array, which should accept any of these course part types:

type CoursePart = CoursePartOne | CoursePartTwo | CoursePartThree;
