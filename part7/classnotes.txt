NOTES:

Notes for 7.9 - 7.21
These exercises deal with CSS 
which I use very often and am familiar with
as well as refactoring previous assignments state 
to Redux / Redux-Store, which was already covered in part 6.
At this point I wish to move on with the course to parts 8-10, 
if time permits I will return to these assignments.
